                ● DNA data storage is the process of encoding and decoding binary data to and from DNA synthesis
                strands.<br>
                ● DNA digital data storage process includes recording, storing, and retrieving information on DNA
                molecules.<br>
                ● DNA data storage has many advantages for storing digital data and is a great deal.<br>
                ● While DNA as a storage medium has enormous potential because of its high storage density, its
                practical use is currently severely limited because of its high cost and very slow read and write
                times.<br>
                ● To store a binary digital file as DNA, different bits (binary digits) 1, 0 are converted into letters
                A, C, G, and T.<br>
                ● These letters represent the four main compounds in DNA: A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine,
                and T for thymine.<br>
                ● The physical storage medium is a synthetic DNA molecule, in which the compounds of these four
                compounds are included in the sequence of bits in the digital file sequence.<br>
                ● To recover data, the sequence representing the DNA molecule is decoded back into the original sequence
                of A, C, G, and T bits to1 and 0.<br>

                <p>
                    ● In the process of DNA digital data storage, binary data is encoded and decoded to and from
                    synthesized
                    strands of DNA, converting DNA into a new form of information technology.<br>
                    ● DNA storage requires cutting-edge technologies in data compression and security so that a sequence
                    can
                    be designed and the potential of DNA and redundant of DNA can be realized in order to improve the
                    accuracy of the recovered information in the line.<br>
                    ● The most important parts of the system are in existence for a long time from mankind.<br>
                    ● After determining the order in which the letter should go, the DNA sequences are the letters
                    produced
                    by the letter with chemical reactions.<br>
                    ● These reactions are operated by the pieces of equipment which take the A, C, G, and T bottles and
                    mix
                    them in a liquid solution with other chemicals to control the reactions that specify the sequence of
                    physical DNA strands.<br>

                    ● Countless methods for encoding data in DNA are possible. The optimal methods are those that make
                    economical use of DNA and protect against errors.<Br>
                    ● If the message DNA is intended to be stored for a long period of time, for example, 1,000 years,
                    it is also helpful if the sequence is obviously artificial and the reading frame is easy to
                    identify<Br>

            <div>
                <p>
                    ● Several simple methods for encoding text have been proposed. Most of these involve translating
                    each letter into a corresponding "codon", consisting of a unique small sequence of nucleotides in a
                    lookup table.

                <h2>
                    &#9830; Encoding arbitrary data
                </h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    ● To encode arbitrary data in DNA, the data is typically first converted into ternary (base 3) data
                    rather than binary (base 2) data. Each digit (or "trit") is then converted to a nucleotide using a
                    lookup table.<br>
                    ● To prevent homopolymers (repeating nucleotides), which can cause problems with accurate
                    sequencing, the result of the lookup also depends on the preceding nucleotide. Using the example
                    lookup table below, if the previous nucleotide in the sequence is T (thymine), and the trit is 2,
                    the next nucleotide will be G (guanine).<br>

                    ● Various systems may be incorporated to partition and address the data, as well as to protect it
                    from
                    errors.<br>
                    ● One approach to error correction is to regularly intersperse synchronization nucleotides between
                    the
                    information-encoding nucleotides. These synchronization nucleotides can act as scaffolds when
                    reconstructing the sequence from multiple overlapping strands.<br>
