                &#9830; DNA Annealing
            </h2>
            <p>
                DNA Annealing is a fundamental process in molecular biology that involves the pairing of complementary
                strands of DNA to form a stable double-stranded structure. It plays a crucial role in various biological
                processes, including DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Understanding DNA annealing is
                essential
                for many molecular biology techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, and
                hybridization-based assays.

                DNA annealing occurs under specific conditions of temperature and ionic strength. The process typically
                requires heating the DNA mixture to an elevated temperature, known as the denaturation temperature, to
                separate the double-stranded DNA into single strands. Then, the temperature is gradually lowered to
                allow
                the complementary strands to reassociate and anneal. For visualizing DNA annealing the method is called
                gel
                electrophoresis.

                    The temperature at which half of the DNA strands are denatured is called the melting temperature
                    (Tm).
                    The
                    Tm is specific to each DNA molecule and depends on its sequence and environmental conditions.
                    Factors
                    affecting the Tm include the length and GC content of the DNA sequence, as GC base pairs have
                    stronger
                    hydrogen bonds compared to AT base pairs.

                    DNA melting can be visualized using various techniques. One common method is UV spectroscopy, where
                    the
                    absorbance of UV light by DNA is measured. As the DNA strands separate during melting, the
                    absorbance
                    increases due to the exposure of the nucleotide bases to the solvent. Another approach is
                    fluorescence-based
                    methods that use fluorescent dyes or probes that specifically bind to single-stranded or
                    double-stranded
                    DNA.
